t

I want to work for the Knowledge House because there is a gap bewtween the have an the have nots.

I have talent that help to bridge that gap.

Community is important to me

We are behind in terms of earning power

We are also behind in bring our skills back into the neighborhood.

This model doesnâ€™t sustain the neighborhoodd

People who build their community using technology resources ensure that their future generations 
dont succumb to future poverty or gentrification

I like to teaching and helping others solve their technical problems.

The knowledge house seems like the place to start that?
